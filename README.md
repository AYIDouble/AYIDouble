Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer with a keen interest in financial markets, analysis, and reverse engineering. I've been developing software for 10+ years, with a focus on building robust, scalable, and secure applications.

I love exploring how software systems work by reverse engineering and analyzing their code. This has given me a deep understanding of how software operates at the lowest levels, and I've used this knowledge to improve and optimize code in a variety of applications.

My GitHub profile showcases a range of projects that highlight my expertise in these areas. From financial market tools to reverse engineering, each project demonstrates my commitment to writing efficient, well-documented, and maintainable code.

I believe that a deep understanding of technical indicators, economics and chart patterns is essential for developing effective investment strategies. By combining this knowledge with my expertise in programming, I'm able to create custom applications that automate the analysis of market data, identify potential opportunities, and provide real-time insights.

If you're interested in collaborating on a project or have any questions about my work, feel free to reach out. Thanks for stopping by!
